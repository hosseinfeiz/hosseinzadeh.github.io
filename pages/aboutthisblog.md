## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why this blog can help you with your phd?

I am currently working as a full-time phd student on **Computer Vision/Deep Learning** with focus on Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Animation and Intelligent Agents, In this blog I shared my progress in these different subjects and how it helped me to complete my phd program. You can see how a PHD student works on his/her project and maybe apply the same things in your projects.



## <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is the best way to use the posts of this site?
I am going to try to write as simple as possible and chronologically regarding my prgress in my project. When I learn something new that is helpful for progressing my project or if I made a mistake that cost me a lot of time, I will post it so that others don't experience the same mistake.
